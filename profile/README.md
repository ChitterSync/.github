## 🌍 Mission: A Better Internet

The internet should be a playground for creativity, freedom, and connection.  
Instead, it’s often riddled with ads, algorithms, and corporate control.

**ChitterSync flips the script.**  

Here, you get:

- **Full control of your content** — not an algorithm  
- **Fair monetization** — no selling your users’ data  
- **Thriving communities** — free from ad farming  
- **Innovation over surveillance capitalism**  

This isn’t just another social network — it’s a platform for a **free, open, and expressive internet.**
