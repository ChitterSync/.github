# Welcome to the *Official* ChitterSync Github Org
this is the home of everything ChitterSync, from ChitterSync itself, Gia, VeloSync, CommunityForged, and many more sub-services to come!

## Why we made ChitterSync open-source
our goal with the site is to be as transparent as possible, so users know
- where their data ends up
  - Why this is important? we want to make sure people feel safe and better knowlegded of what we do with user data, where it goes, ect. 
- how ChitterSync works
  - Why this is important? people in the GitHub Community can rinse out our mistakes with [Repository Issues](https://github.com/ChitterSync/.github/issues) helping us improve ChitterSync in the long run!
- what other sub-services there are
  - Why this is important? its not very easy to find our other sub-services sometimes, thats why we have it all layed out in the [Org Repositories](https://github.com/orgs/ChitterSync/repositories) or [Profile Pins](https://github.com/ChitterSync/)
